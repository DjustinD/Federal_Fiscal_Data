## Methodology Notes

### Data Collection Period
- **Analysis Period**: Fiscal Years 2006-2024
- **USA Fiscal Year**: October 1 to September 30
- **Canada Fiscal Year**: April 1 to March 31

### Currency and Units
- **USA Data**: Billions of U.S. Dollars (USD), nominal terms
- **Canada Data**: Billions of Canadian Dollars (CAD), nominal terms
- **No inflation adjustment**: All values in nominal terms to maintain consistency with official government reporting

### Calculated Metrics
Two derived metrics are calculated from the source data:

1. **Spending Ratio** = Expenditure Ã· Revenue
   - Ratio > 1.0 indicates deficit spending
   - Ratio < 1.0 indicates surplus
   - Ratio = 1.0 indicates balanced budget

2. **Years Behind in Tax Collection** = Total Debt Ã· Revenue
   - Represents how many years of current revenue would be needed to pay off accumulated debt
   - Key metric for understanding "deferred taxation"
   - Demonstrates intergenerational fiscal burden

### Data Verification
- Cross-referenced multiple sources for consistency
- Prioritized official government sources over third-party aggregators
- Where discrepancies existed, official treasury/finance department data was used
- Some minor variations exist due to:
  - Fiscal year alignment differences
  - Preliminary vs. final data releases
  - Different accounting methods (cash vs. accrual basis)

### Known Data Limitations
- **COVID-19 Impact (2020-2021)**: Extraordinary spending resulted in anomalous data points that may skew trend analysis
- **Indigenous Settlements (Canada, 2022-2023)**: Large one-time expenses for historical claims settlement
- **Accounting Adjustments**: Some years include significant actuarial adjustments or one-time items
- **Currency Comparison**: Direct USD-CAD comparisons should account for exchange rates and economic size differences
